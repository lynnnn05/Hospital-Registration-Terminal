## 📍 Task 1: OOP-based Application Development
**Core Implementation:** `sensor_node.py`, `main.py`

### Description of Core Functions
This module simulates edge devices in a smart city network. It handles the initialization of different sensor types (Air Quality Monitors, Traffic Cameras) and manages their specific hardware states.

### Usage of OOP Concepts
* **Abstraction (ADT):** `AbstractSensor` enforces a standard `process_signal()` interface for all edge devices.
* **Encapsulation:** Hardware states (`_battery_level`) are protected and strictly accessed via getter/setter methods.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Specific classes (`AirQualitySensor`, `TrafficCamera`) inherit from `AbstractSensor` and override `process_signal()` for unique behaviors.
* **Class & Static Methods:** Uses a `@classmethod` to track the global active sensor registry and a `@staticmethod` for ADC conversion utility.
* **Magic Methods:** Overloads `__eq__` (preventing ID conflicts) and `__str__` (formatting output strings).

## 📍 Task 2: Self-study on Data Structure & Algorithm
**Core Implementation:** `network_manager.py`, `main.py`

### Introduction of Chosen Topics
* **New Data Structure:** **Graph (Adjacency List)**. The city's network topology is modeled as a weighted graph, which is highly memory-efficient for sparse embedded networks.
* **New Algorithm:** **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**. Used to dynamically calculate the optimal, lowest-latency data transmission route between any two network nodes.

### Implementation Details
The `NetworkManager` class utilizes a Priority Queue (`heapq`) to execute Dijkstra's algorithm. It efficiently returns the best transmission path and total network latency for data packets traveling from remote sensors to central servers.

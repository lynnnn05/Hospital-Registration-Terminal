An enterprise-grade, Object-Oriented IoT energy management dashboard designed to solve real-world energy waste problems within the Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU) campus. It simulates a localized Edge AI node that manages various campus devices, calculates dynamic power consumption, and executes asynchronous tasks via a FIFO Command Queue.

## 📌 1. Problem Definition & Motivation
**Real-World Context:** University campuses face significant challenges in managing energy efficiency. In places like HKMU's EECS laboratories (Block E) and lecture theaters (Block A), high-power devices such as Air Conditioners and specialized measurement tools (e.g., Oscilloscopes) are frequently left running idle. 

**The Solution:** This project builds a **Smart Campus IoT Edge Controller**. It provides a centralized software hub utilizing OOP principles to abstract, monitor, and intelligently schedule power states for different device types, demonstrating a scalable solution for a Green Campus (ESG) initiative.

## ✨ 2. Key Features
* **🔌 Polymorphic Analytics:** Dynamically calculates real-time power draw (W) and estimated hourly costs (HKD) using device-specific logic.
* **⏳ Asynchronous Task Queue (FIFO):** Incorporates core Data Structure concepts. Hardware commands are wrapped as lambda functions and queued for safe, sequential batch processing.
* **🍃 One-Click Eco-Mode:** A centralized aggregation command that forces all active devices into a powered-down state to prevent overnight energy waste.
* **🖥️ Modern Dark-Mode GUI:** A decoupled, responsive Tkinter dashboard demonstrating professional UI/UX separation from business logic.

## 🏗️ 3. Object-Oriented Architecture (Rubric Mapping)
This project strictly adheres to all OOP concepts required by the COMP2090SEF curriculum.

### I. Abstraction & Inheritance
* **`CampusDevice (ABC)`**: An Abstract Base Class defining the blueprint for all hardware nodes.
* **Derived Classes**: `SmartAC` and `LabOscilloscope` inherit from the base class, implementing localized behaviors.

### II. Polymorphism
* The Hub calls `get_power_consumption()` on all objects without needing to know their specific type. Each class calculates its draw using its own unique algorithm (e.g., Temperature delta for AC vs. State-based for Lab tools).

### III. Encapsulation
* All sensitive attributes (e.g., `_device_id`, `_is_on`) are protected and only accessible via secure getters and setters, ensuring system integrity.

### IV. Advanced Features
* **Class/Static Methods:** Used for system-wide analytics and room code validation.
* **Magic Methods:** Overridden `__str__` for logging, `__eq__` for ID verification, and `__add__` for summing power consumption.
